# Founder Readiness → GoHighLevel data map

**For:** Marcus Jones, wiring the GoHighLevel side
**From:** the ATM Founder Platform build
**Status:** live on the site; parameter names await your confirmation

When a founder finishes an assessment and clicks through to book, the booking
link now carries their result with them, so GHL can record where they came
from, which assessment they took and which band they landed in. This note sets
out exactly what arrives.

## 1. Band names

### Readiness Diagnostic (RD): your action 3

Confirmed and wired. The four `RD` band values are exactly as you specified:

| Score | Band name |
|---|---|
| 85+ | Transaction-Ready |
| 70–84 | Readiness Project Candidate |
| 50–69 | Roadmap Tier |
| below 50 | Foundation Tier |

**One correction to the filename, so your notes match the repo.** You wrote
that RD is `diagnostic.html`. It is not, it is **`transaction-readiness.html`**.
Everything else in your description was right, and identified that file
precisely: it is the 24-metric instrument (`t("24 metrics defined",
METRICS.length === 24)`), titled "Transaction Readiness Assessment", and it
already carried those four band names at exactly those four thresholds. We
have tagged that page `RD`.

`diagnostic.html` is a genuinely separate, live assessment, the
**Multiplier Diagnostic**: 20 questions, six themes, instrument id
`multiplier_diagnostic`, with its own four bands at its own thresholds:

| Score | Band name |
|---|---|
| 91+ | Highly Ready |
| 71–90 | Strong Potential |
| 41–70 | Emerging |
| below 41 | At Risk |

The two pages cross-link each other: the Multiplier Diagnostic offers "go a
level deeper with the Transaction Readiness Assessment", and the Transaction
Readiness Assessment calls itself "the deal-grade instrument behind our
Multiplier Diagnostic".

We renamed nothing. Because its band vocabulary is not RD's, `diagnostic.html`
currently sends **`fr_source` only** (no assessment, no score, no band) so
it cannot contaminate your RD band picklist. **If you want its results in GHL
too, give us a fourth assessment code** (`MD` would be the obvious one) and
the four band values above, and we will wire it in one edit. Until then those
bookings arrive attributed but untagged.

### Funding Scorecard: now implemented

Three bands, on `investor-ready.html`. Thresholds are unchanged from the
existing scoring; only the names are new:

| Score | Band name |
|---|---|
| 80+ | Raise Ready |
| 60–79 | Almost Ready |
| below 60 | Getting Ready |

Per your instruction, the Funded Female Founders module has **no** band model
and creates no band tags.

### Proposed: four stream self-assessments, awaiting your confirmation

The six-door front door adds a free, ungated eight-statement self-assessment
to each of the four stream pages that do not already carry a diagnostic. Each
scores 1–5 per statement, reports a percentage of the maximum, and shares one
band model. These codes and band names are **our proposal**; nothing is
final until you confirm them.

| Page | Proposed `fr_assessment` | Stream |
|---|---|---|
| `pitch.html` | `PI` | Pitching |
| `commercial-acceleration.html` | `CA` | Commercial Acceleration |
| `finance-advisory.html` | `FA` | Insourcing: Finance Advisory |

Shared bands (identical on all four):

| Score | Band name |
|---|---|
| 80+ | Strong |
| 60–79 | Building |
| 40–59 | Emerging |
| below 40 | At risk |

Each page's eight statements are six that measure the stream itself plus two
that are the same on every page: the business case ("We have a clear, written
business case that a stranger could follow") and revenue predictability
("Our revenue is predictable enough to forecast the next twelve months with
confidence"). Those two drive the routing shown on the result; the routing
itself is **not** sent in the link, you can derive it from the assessment,
score and band, or tell us to add an `fr_route` parameter.

**Routing rules, as set by Madeleine**, and the internal owner of each
outcome. Owners are named here only; the public page names the service,
never the person.

| Outcome | Rule (as coded) | Service shown on the page | Internal owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| Founder needs an M&A deal or a raise | Funding Scorecard (`IR`) | Funding Scorecard | David |
| Founder is ready to sell | Exit Ready, Multiplier Diagnostic, then `RD` | Exit Ready | David |
| Clear business case and revenue, weak stream | business case ≥ 3 **and** revenue ≥ 3, stream score below 80 | the Pitching programme (on `pitch`); Commercial Acceleration (on `commercial-acceleration`); Finance Advisory (on `sourcing`) | Jacob (Pitching; the meeting notes also name "T", which is unverified transcription and needs Madeleine's confirmation); Marcus (Commercial Acceleration); Marcus and the insourced finance function (`sourcing`) |
| No accounting function, no sales pipeline | business case ≤ 2 **or** revenue ≤ 2, whatever the page and whatever the stream score | Finance Advisory and sales pipeline support (`finance-advisory.html`) | Marcus and the insourced finance function |
| Strong on everything | business case ≥ 3 **and** revenue ≥ 3, stream score 80+ | Readiness Call, with the Funding Scorecard or Exit Ready as the likely next step | David |

The four pages remain free and ungated: no name, no email, no consent box,
nothing written to Supabase or to browser storage. The only thing that leaves
the page is the booking link below, and only if the founder clicks it.

## 2. What the booking link carries

Base URL is unchanged:

```
https://api.leadconnectorhq.com/widget/booking/Av6i7gL0YzbszYFfnKqQ
```

Parameters are appended to it, all values URL-encoded:

| Parameter | Value | Sent from |
|---|---|---|
| `fr_assessment` | `RD`, `IR` or `FFF`, plus the proposed `PI`, `CA`, `FA` | the assessment pages |
| `fr_score` | integer percentage, `0`–`100` | scored assessments only |
| `fr_band` | the exact band name string | scored assessments only |
| `fr_source` | one controlled source value (below) | every booking link |

Which page sends what:

| Page | `fr_assessment` | Score | Band |
|---|---|---|---|
| `transaction-readiness.html` | `RD` | yes | the four RD bands |
| `investor-ready.html` | `IR` | yes | the three IR bands |
| `funding.html` | `FFF` | no | no |
| `diagnostic.html` | *(none: pending a code)* | no | no |
| `pitch.html` | `PI` *(proposed)* | yes, once scored | Strong / Building / Emerging / At risk |
| `commercial-acceleration.html` | `CA` *(proposed)* | yes, once scored | Strong / Building / Emerging / At risk |
| `finance-advisory.html` | `FA` *(proposed)* | yes, once scored | Strong / Building / Emerging / At risk |
| all other pages with a booking CTA | *(none)* | no | no |

`fr_source` is always present. `fr_assessment` appears only on the assessment
modules. `fr_score` and `fr_band` are **omitted entirely** where there is no
score, they are never sent empty. On the four stream pages the booking link
sends `fr_source` only until the founder scores the self-assessment; after
that the assessment, score and band are added.

Worked examples:

```
…/Av6i7gL0YzbszYFfnKqQ?fr_assessment=RD&fr_score=76&fr_band=Readiness%20Project%20Candidate&fr_source=Investor%20Network
…/Av6i7gL0YzbszYFfnKqQ?fr_assessment=IR&fr_score=72&fr_band=Almost%20Ready&fr_source=LinkedIn%20Paid
…/Av6i7gL0YzbszYFfnKqQ?fr_assessment=PI&fr_score=65&fr_band=Building&fr_source=Website%20Organic
…/Av6i7gL0YzbszYFfnKqQ?fr_assessment=FA&fr_score=35&fr_band=At%20risk&fr_source=Referral
…/Av6i7gL0YzbszYFfnKqQ?fr_assessment=FFF&fr_source=Referral
…/Av6i7gL0YzbszYFfnKqQ?fr_source=Founder%20Readiness%20Direct
```

### Controlled `fr_source` values

Investor Network · LinkedIn Organic · LinkedIn Paid · Website Organic ·
Referral · Partner · Event · Outbound · Existing Client ·
Founder Readiness Direct · Direct · Other

We read `utm_source`, `src` or `source` from the URL the founder arrived on,
in that order, and match it to the list above. Matching ignores case,
punctuation and separators, so `linkedin_paid`, `LinkedIn-Paid` and
`linkedin paid` all resolve to `LinkedIn Paid`. Anything we do not recognise
becomes `Other`. Nothing in the URL at all becomes `Founder Readiness Direct`.

## 3. Two things to confirm, and one limitation

**The parameter names are our proposal, not a decision.** `fr_assessment`,
`fr_score`, `fr_band` and `fr_source` are placeholders we chose so the work
could ship. Tell us the field names GHL actually expects for your custom
fields and we will change them, it is a small edit and we will turn it round
on request. The same goes for the controlled values if your picklists differ.

**The booking link still carries no identity.** No name, email, company or
phone number, and no identifier that could be joined back to a person. The
founder's identity and their marketing consent *for the booking* are collected
by the GHL booking form, at the point of booking, never in the link. That has
not changed.

**But the platform now does collect identity, at the assessment.** On ATM's
instruction, all four scored assessments are gated: the founder sees their
headline score and band for free, then must give first name, work email,
company, role and revenue band, and tick an explicit consent box, before the
full report renders. There is no skip. On submit, the answers, score, band and
those details are written to ATM's own Supabase `leads` table, not to GHL.

Two consequences worth planning for on your side:

- **You will have the same person in two places.** A founder who completes an
  assessment and then books appears once in `leads` (with their answers) and
  once in GHL (from the booking form). The join key is the email address they
  typed in each, which may differ. If you want them reconciled, the cleanest
  route is a scheduled export from `leads` into GHL keyed on email, tell us
  and we will scope it.
- **Consent is recorded per assessment, not globally.** The `leads.consent`
  column records that the founder agreed to ATM storing their answers and
  contacting them about their results, at that timestamp. It is not consent
  for a wider marketing programme, and it is separate from whatever consent
  the GHL booking form captures. Do not treat one as covering the other.

Still true, and worth stating plainly: nothing is written to cookies,
localStorage or sessionStorage anywhere on the site. There is no analytics and
there are no ad pixels. Campaign source is read from the URL and passed
straight on, which is why it survives only a single journey (below).

**Campaign source survives one journey only.** The free pages carry no
cookies, no localStorage and no analytics, that is a deliberate design rule,
not an oversight. So the source is read from the URL the founder is on at that
moment and passed straight to GHL. In practice:

- a founder who lands on a campaign link and books in the same visit will
  carry the right source; but
- a founder who lands on a campaign link, navigates to a page whose link
  does not carry the parameter, and books from there will arrive as
  `Founder Readiness Direct`.

There is no way to close that gap without adding tracking to the free pages,
which we will not do. If reliable multi-page attribution matters more than the
no-tracking rule, that is a decision for David, not something we can engineer
around.

Finally, the link degrades safely: if anything in the parameter-building code
fails, the founder is sent to the plain booking URL. Booking never breaks
because attribution broke.
