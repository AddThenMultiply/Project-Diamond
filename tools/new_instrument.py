<h1>Would the business notice if you took three months off?</h1>
<p class="lede">Most founder-led businesses have one asset a buyer cannot buy: the founder. The customers who only deal with you, the know-how in your head, the decisions that stop at your desk, the revenue that arrives because you sold it. Every one of those is a discount at exit and a ceiling before it. This self-assessment measures how far the business depends on you, and tells you which dependence to remove first.</p>
<p style="font-size:0.9rem;margin-top:0.6rem;"><a href="#assess"><b>Take the free ten-minute self-assessment ↓</b></a>. It tells you where the dependence sits, and what to do about it.</p>

<h2>Who this is for</h2>
<div class="grid3">
<div class="card"><h3>The founder who is still the best salesperson</h3><p>The biggest accounts are yours. That is a strength at £2 million and the largest single discount at £10 million.</p></div>
<div class="card"><h3>The founder every decision comes back to</h3><p>Pricing, hiring, spending, a difficult customer: all of it waits for you. The team is capable; the business is not designed to let them act.</p></div>
<div class="card"><h3>The founder two years from a sale</h3><p>A buyer will ask what happens on the day you leave. If the honest answer is "I do not know", the price already reflects it.</p></div>
</div>

<h2>The problem</h2>
<p class="body">Dependence is invisible from the inside because the founder fills the gaps without noticing. From the outside it is the first thing a buyer's advisers look for: which customers would follow you out, which processes exist only in your memory, who would run the business in the first hundred days, and whether the revenue was won by a system or by a person. The answers set the earn-out, the lock-in and the discount. Reducing dependence is the largest value lever most founders have, and the one that takes longest, which is why it belongs in the Consolidate phase, well before a sale is in view.</p>

<h2>What we do</h2>
<p class="body">Founder Dependence is not a service of its own. It is the diagnosis that points to the right one. Where the dependence is commercial, <a href="commercial-acceleration.html">Commercial Acceleration</a> builds the sales pathway and the people who run it. Where it is financial and operational, <a href="finance-advisory.html">Finance Advisory</a> puts a finance function and a management rhythm in place that does not need you in every meeting.

<li><b>A suggested plan.</b> Which service removes which dependence, and where to start.</li>

<h1>An exit is a life event. Are you ready for the life?</h1>
<p class="lede">Every exit process ATM has run starts with the same conversation, and it is not about the business. It is about the number you need, what you will do the Monday after completion, whether the people around you agree, and the deal you would refuse. Founders who have answered those questions set their own terms. Founders who have not take the market's. This self-assessment asks them before a buyer does.</p>

<h2>The problem</h2>
<p class="body">Deals fall over on the founder more often than on the business. A number that turns out not to be enough once tax and the next twenty years are counted. A founder who cannot picture life without the business and starts to slow the process down without meaning to. Co-owners who never quite agreed. A structure accepted in the excitement of an offer that leaves the founder working for the buyer for three years. None of these show up in a data room, and every one of them costs more than any metric in it. Founder Clarity, the first phase of ATM's exit advisory process, exists to settle them first.</p>
