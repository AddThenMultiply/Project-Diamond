# ATM Founder Platform: repo instructions

This repo is the **ATM Founder Platform** for addthenmultiply.com: David B Horne's advisory practice (author of *Add Then Multiply* and *Funded Female Founders*). Built by Madeleine Joubert for David. It productises ATM's two advisory service lines so one advisor runs many concurrent founder engagements.

**Core rule of the product:** AI drafts, analyses, tracks and assembles; the human advisor (David) decides, relates and signs off. Nothing customer-facing ships without a named human approval. Encode this in the UX and the database.

## The platform (four-tier value stream)

Public site pages (all single-file HTML): `index.html` (overview + value stream + ecosystem) · `diagnostic.html` (the free front-door **Multiplier Diagnostic**: 20 questions across six themes, 1–5 scale, finance/funding/exit weighted ×1.5, bands Highly Ready 91+ / Strong Potential 71 / Emerging 41 / At Risk) · `transaction-readiness.html` (the deal-grade **Transaction Readiness Assessment**: 24 weighted metrics, Exit 35% / Deal 40% / Operational 25%, 1–5 rubric per metric, bands Transaction-Ready 85+ / Readiness Project Candidate 70 / Roadmap Tier 50 / Foundation Tier) · `investor-ready.html` (14-question Investor Ready diagnostic, bands Raise Ready 80+ / Almost Ready 60 / Getting Ready) · `ethical-acquisitions.html` (Ethical Acquisitions Scorecard) · `roadmap.html` · `sourcing.html` (Insourcing: Finance Advisory, with a free FA self-assessment) · `pitch.html` (Pitching, framed for FACE, with a free PI self-assessment) · `commercial-acceleration.html` (Commercial Acceleration, with a free CA self-assessment) · `readiness-project.html` (the three engagement tiers and the turnover tiers) · `funding.html` (FFF module: assets checklist, capital-routes table, promotion-language checker, grant application builder) · `investors.html` (institutional investor relationships, no count published) · `founders.html` (3,000 founder CEO network).

**The six front doors on `index.html`, in order:** Investor Ready (Fund) · Grow by Acquiring (Acquire) · Commercial Acceleration (Consolidate) · Insourcing: Finance Advisory (Consolidate) · Pitching (Fund and Exit) · Exit Ready (Exit). All six are FACE. **Never reintroduce "Pitch, Publish, Product", the Key Person of Influence method or any Dent Global wording**: there is no agreement to use that IP. `product.html` and `publish.html` were deleted for that reason.

**Header nav, every public page:** Overview · Investor Ready · Exit Ready · Services (`index.html#services`) · Network (`investors.html`) · a red "Book a call" button (`a.nav-cta`, the `BOOKING_URL`). `exit-ready.html` is a legacy redirect to the diagnostic, keep it. `deal-ready.html` is now the "Grow by Acquiring" landing page (the acquisition fork from the homepage hero).

**The two scored front doors are different instruments and must not be conflated:** `diagnostic.html` is the 20-question Multiplier Diagnostic; `transaction-readiness.html` is the 24-metric Transaction Readiness Assessment. They have different band vocabularies. Booking hand-offs tag the latter as `RD`, see `GHL-DATA-MAP.md`.

Authenticated pages (behind the paid workspace boundary): `intake.html` · `exit-ready-workspace.html` · `deal-ready-workspace.html` · `investor-mandates.html` (advisor-only register) · `advisor-console.html`.

Value stream: **Diagnostics (free) → Personalised Roadmap → Insource Sourcing → Readiness Project (full engagement)**, which maps onto the ATM Exit Advisory phases (Founder Clarity → Gap Analysis → Business Readiness → Transaction Execution) and the 7-phase M&A Advisory Process. Content taxonomy is the **FACE methodology** (Fund, Acquire, Consolidate, Exit). Full design: `BLUEPRINT.md`.

Voice: ATM founder-first, warm, direct, UK English ("an exit is a life event"). Rigour in substance, warmth in tone, never institutional jargon. **No em dashes anywhere: copy, code comments, docs.** Use commas, colons, brackets or full stops instead (David Horne's rule, September 2026).

**Visual system (the live palette: every page declares it in one `:root` block):** ink `#111827` · slate `#475569` · off-white background `#F8FAFC` · borders `#E2E8F0` · charcoal `#2B2A29` (`--navy`: header bars, headings, booking-CTA anchors) · brand red `#E4342D` (`--brand`: the 4px rule under every header bar, the hero mark, door-card tops, fills where no text sits on the colour) · accent red `#C8231C` (`--accent`: form/submit buttons, links, the nav "Book a call" button; this darker shade keeps white-on-red and red-on-white text at AA contrast, which the pure brand red does not) with hover `#A61D17` · brand-mark orange `#F38E00` (the "MULTIPLY" wordmark only) · Georgia serif headings, system sans body. Status tokens: good `#15803D`, warn `#B45309`, bad `#B91C1C`. Amber `#B45309` is a status token only; it is no longer a button or link colour. The header stays dark.

CTA rule: **booking/navigation anchors (`a.cta`, `a.book-cta`) are charcoal `--navy`; form and submit buttons (`button.cta`, `.btn`, `button.gold`) and the nav `a.nav-cta` are accent red `--accent`.** No other primary-action colours: there is no accent blue on the site, and `#0A192F`/`#D4AF37` (a former gold-on-dark identity) must never reappear.

## Hard rules

- Self-contained single-file HTML pages: inline CSS/JS, no build step, no frameworks, avoid external CDNs. Mobile-responsive. **UK English everywhere.**
- **Scored assessments are gated; everything else is open.** The four scored instruments (`diagnostic.html`, `transaction-readiness.html`, `investor-ready.html`, `ethical-acquisitions.html`) show the headline score and band for free, then require name, work email, company, role and an explicit consent tick before the full report renders. There is no skip bypass. On submit the answers, score, band and those details are written to `leads`. Every other page, including `funding.html`'s promotion checker and grant builder, stays open with no sign-up.
- **No tracking, still.** No analytics, no ad pixels, no cookies, and nothing in localStorage or sessionStorage anywhere on the site. Campaign source is read from the URL and passed straight to the booking link; it is never persisted. Because nothing is stored on the visitor's device, no PECR cookie banner is required, keep it that way, and if that ever changes the banner has to land in the same change.
- Auth (Supabase magic-link) still begins only at the paid workspace boundary. The assessment gate is lead capture, not an account.
- All AI calls go through Supabase Edge Functions (Claude API, server-side). Never call AI from the browser; never commit the service-role key or any API secret. Supabase URL + anon key live in one config constant.
- Phase advancement requires a `human_signoffs` row (advisor/admin only), enforce the gate in Postgres, not just the UI. Log every AI call to `ai_runs` (task, model, input hash, output, timestamp).
- Every diagnostic scoring engine ships with a browser-console `runTests()` harness; run it after any scoring change.
- The Readiness Call CTA uses a single `BOOKING_URL` constant (the GoHighLevel scheduler link, swap in one place if the calendar changes).
- Deploys: GitHub Pages. If Actions-path deploys fail repeatedly, use the legacy build trigger: `POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pages/builds`.
- **Brand isolation:** ATM assets only. Never copy content, code or links from any other client's repositories or websites.
- **Regulatory guardrail (FCA):** the platform must never arrange investments, match founders to investors, or publish financial promotions. Investor introductions happen only through ATM's authorised transaction partner, offline. Keep the wording on `investors.html` ("does not arrange investments…") intact in spirit whenever editing.
- **Verified numbers only:** the 3,000 founder CEO network is a real, owner-verified figure. The investor base is described as "an extensive network of institutional investor relationships" and no count is published until David confirms a verified figure. Do not invent statistics; book-sourced claims ($8.7tn opportunity, 13× warm introductions, Kanze research) must keep their citations.
- **Commercial terms are private:** the Story-C Ltd / ATM revenue-share agreement is documented in a private annex outside this repo. Never publish fee splits, settlement terms or the ownership structure on the public site. The only public price is Marcus's client-facing line on `sourcing.html`: "Insourced Finance Function from £1,000 plus VAT per month, with final pricing agreed following scoping." Commercial Acceleration copy stays generic: no client names, contract values or board dates.
- **Turnover tiers (awaiting David's sign-off):** Project One £1m to under £20m · Project Two £20m to under £200m · Scaling £200m and above. Three continuous tiers, no gaps. Turnover guides the initial routing; the Readiness Call confirms need and complexity, and the copy says so.
- **Pipeline language:** leads progress through business stages (steps 1 to 5); never describe them as hot or cold.
- **Regulatory position (Eversheds-cleared, wording is David's decision):** Add Then Multiply is not authorised or regulated by the FCA. Fundraising and M&A work is led by David as an officer of the client company (CFO or similar, often a legal director), for and on behalf of that company. Exits are not a regulated activity. Public copy must never imply ATM is a regulated adviser, that an advisor "approves" deal flow, or that ATM itself conducts regulated fundraising or M&A.
